          <h3>Chaos Collapse Movie Poster Design</h3>
          <img src="Images/Ooda_Movie Poster.png" alt="description of image"width="200px">
          <p> For this project, I designed an attention-grabbing movie poster for the sci-fi apocalyptic film Chaos Collapse: A Biohazard Apocalypse. The poster visually captures the film's intense and chaotic atmosphere, reflecting the story of a man-made chemical virus, XZT, that devastates the world. As the virus threatens all life, the world descends into chaos, with survivors struggling to stay alive. The poster emphasizes the themes of survival, danger, and the fight for a cure, aligning with the film's genre and story. The design aims to intrigue audiences and effectively brand the movie for its release..</p>

          <img src="Images/Ooda-Pjt4-Mockup-b.png" alt="description of image" width="200px">
          <p>For the root beer label design, I created a bold concept for RefreshBev’s new drink, Dragon’s Brew, featuring the Cherry Spice flavor. The design incorporates a dragon mascot, bold accents, and rough fonts. This makes the label eye-catching, reinforcing the bold character of the flavor and the brand's identity.

          <img src="Images/Annual report mockup 1.png" alt="description of image"width="200px">
          <p>For the Wildlife Conservatory's annual report, I designed a professional, nature-inspired guide. Using muted tones and simple design elements, the report highlights key business statistics, mission, goals, and financial impact, aligning with the conservatory's values.
